### What's up man 👋  
Name's **Asa**, but my friends call me **Ace**.

I'm a **Robotics & Software Engineer** with a passion for building real systems that do real work — whether it's guiding robots through space or crafting intuitive software that small businesses can actually *use*.  

I blend creative problem-solving with technical precision to deliver tools that serve people.

- 🌐 Full-stack engineering (React, Node.js, Mongo, SQL)
- 🧩 Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker
- 🔊 Real-time feedback systems (Bluetooth, audio)
- 🧵 Microcontrollers, low-level firmware, custom GUIs

### 💡 Building: **EtherTech**
> A hybrid consulting and software development firm that empowers small businesses through tailored tech solutions.

We:
- Interview business owners *and* their customers
- Uncover pain points from both ends
- Design jobs-to-be-done solutions
- Deliver custom platforms (POS, ordering, UX/UI revamps)
- Collect micro-fees (e.g., $0.50/purchase) to align success

✨ Revenue = Scalable product sales + usage-based SaaS billing  
🛠️ Maintenance = Monthly request limits + on-demand tiers  
🧰 Support = 48-hour bug response guarantees
