### What's up man 👋  
Name is **Asa**, but my friends call me **Ace**.

---

I'm a Robotics Software Engineer with a passion for building intelligent, responsive robots that can move, see, and reason. I love deploying real systems that do real things — whether it’s controlling quadrupeds, SLAM-ing through tight spaces, or dropping corrective audio from a ROS node.

- 🤖 ROS 2, SLAM, and Navigation.
- 🧠 YOLO, Behavior Classification & Autonomous Feedback.
- 🔊 Bluetooth & Real-time Audio Systems.
- 🛠️ From low-level firmware to full-stack robot behavior.
